= xstow =
I was looking for an easy way to deal with installing things that aren't in the
package manager, like for example the "latest" binaries of java or things like
that. 

I saw xstow and remembered hearing about it elsewhere, here's the basic usage:
install that from packagemanager (newest version not likely to have anything
special, at least I don't think so).

cd to /usr/local
sudo mkdir stow
sudo vim xstow.ini
add the following:
`
[traverse-links]
link = /usr/local/man
`
I'm not sure if the [traverse-links] part is necessary, but it is seeming to
work for me. 

After saving that,
(in /usr/local/stow)
sudo xstow jre1.8.0_121

And now it's usable and the man pages are there too. 

An easy method of adding what things you installed without having to type it out
to a list like this is ls -f ~/.vim/bundle >> usefulList.wiki
